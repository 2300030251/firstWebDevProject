<h2>History</h2><hr>
<p style="font-size:110%;">The Golden temple is famous for its full golden dome, it is one of the most sacred pilgrim spots for Sikhs. The Mandir is built on a 67-ft square of marble and is a two storied structure.<br> Maharaja Ranjit Singh had the upper half of the building built with approximately 400 kg of gold leaf.<br>The construction of the Golden Temple marks an important chapter in the history of Sikhism in India. The foundation for the gurudwara was laid in 1581 and the construction was completed in 1588. In 1604, a copy of the Adi Granth, the principal scripture of Sikhism, was placed inside the gurudwara by Guru Arjan, the fifth Guru of the Sikhs. At that time, the site was called the Ath Sath Tirath. Over the years, the shrine was destroyed many times by the rulers of the Mughal Empire and the Muslim armies marching in from Afghanistan. Each time it was rebuilt by the Sikhs.
